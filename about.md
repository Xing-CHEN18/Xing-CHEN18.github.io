Welcome! I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [Mixed Unit of Physics CNRS/Thales](https://www.cnrs-thales.fr/?lang=fr) in France, working with [Julie Grollier](https://www.neurophysics.cnrs-thales.fr/). I am mainly working on developing novel algorithms for unsupervised/self-supervised learning in neural networks, aiming to enhance their ability to discover hidden patterns in data without the need for labeled inputs. More importantly, the developed learning rule is intended to not only enhance the efficiency of neural networks but also align closely with the learning mechanisms observed in the human brain (so called bio-plausible learning rules).

Before my postdoc, my academic journey began with a PhD at Université Paris-Saclay and Beihang University, where I was fortunate to be co-supervised by [Damien Querlioz](https://sites.google.com/site/damienquerlioz) and [Dafiné Ravelosona](http://integnano.c2n.u-psud.fr/?page_id=146) at [Center for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology](https://www.c2n.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/) (C2N). My fascination with AI took root during a research project at C2N, where I delved into the intricate world of modeling time-series data. This data came from an exciting source: experimental spintronic nano-devices (tiny, cutting-edge components used in the field of electronics). My task involved using them for spoken digit recognition with reservoir computing (check my posts for more info: [What and Why reservoir computing](https://xing-chen18.github.io/Project-What-is-and-why-Reservoir-Computing/), [Memory and Nonlinearity in Reservoir Computing](https://xing-chen18.github.io/Project-Memory-and-Nonlinearity-in-Reservoir-Computing/)). In pursuit of creating a digital counterpart to the physical setup of these devices, I utilized a sophisticated deep learning method known as neural ordinary differential equations. This approach allowed me to predict future data trends with exceptional accuracy and computational efficiency. The success of this project was not only a personal milestone but also a recognized achievement, leading to a publication in _Nature Communications_ and earning the distinction of being selected as an Editor's highlight. Moreover, the methodology I developed proved versatile, extending its application to other dynamic physical systems. This adaptability was demonstrated in another project, where it was used to uncover experimental data, with these findings too being published in _Nature Communications_.

During my PhD, I also had the invaluable opportunity to intern at Huawei's AI lab. There, my focus shifted to industrial data, employing the hidden Markov method for time series modeling. Additionally, I contributed to enhancing deep learning models, specifically in generating realistic face images and videos, and aligning face images for various business applications, including customer service in banks and virtual streaming platforms.

It was during my research project at C2N in France that I discovered my passion for AI, as I tackled complex problems in modeling time-series data from experimental spintronic nano-devices (tiny, cutting-edge components used in the field of electronics) for reservoir computing (a special type of AI technique, check my posts for more info: [What and Why reservoir computing](https://xing-chen18.github.io/Project-What-is-and-why-Reservoir-Computing/), [Memory and Nonlinearity in Reservoir Computing](https://xing-chen18.github.io/Project-Memory-and-Nonlinearity-in-Reservoir-Computing/)). By leveraging a deep learning technique, called neural ordinary differential equations, to create an equivalent digital system to the original physical design, I managed to make predictions on the future data with remarkable accuracy and computational efficiency, the result led to a publication in Nature communications and was selected as Editor's highlights. Beyond that, the proposed method is applicable in modeling other dynamical physics systems and we are able to successfully apply this method into another related project to model and uncover the experimental data. The research findings were also published in Nature communications.
