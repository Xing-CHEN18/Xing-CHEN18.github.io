Welcome! I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [Mixed Unit of Physics CNRS/Thales](https://www.cnrs-thales.fr/?lang=fr) in France, working with [Julie Grollier](https://www.neurophysics.cnrs-thales.fr/). I am mainly working on developing novel algorithms for unsupervised/self-supervised learning in neural networks, aiming to enhance their ability to discover hidden patterns in data without the need for labeled inputs. More importantly, the developed learning rule is intended to not only enhance the efficiency of neural networks but also align closely with the learning mechanisms observed in the human brain (so called bio-plausible learning rule).

Before my postdoc, my academic journey began with a PhD at Université Paris-Saclay and Beihang University, where I was fortunate to be co-supervised by [Damien Querlioz](https://sites.google.com/site/damienquerlioz) and [Dafiné Ravelosona](http://integnano.c2n.u-psud.fr/?page_id=146) at [Center for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology](https://www.c2n.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/) (C2N). It was during my research project at C2N in France that I discovered my passion for AI, as I tackled complex problems in reservoir computing, a special type of AI technique for modeling time-series data (check my posts for more info: [What and Why reservoir computing](https://xing-chen18.github.io/Project-What-is-and-why-Reservoir-Computing/), [Memory and Nonlinearity in Reservoir Computing](https://xing-chen18.github.io/Project-Memory-and-Nonlinearity-in-Reservoir-Computing/)). using the unique properties of spintronic nano-devices. By leveraging machine learning techniques (more specifically, neural ordinary differential equations) to create an equivalent system to the original physical design, I managed to achieve remarkable accuracy and computational efficiency, the result led to a publication in Nature communications. Beyond that, the proposed method is applicable in modeling other dynamical system. Following this idea, we are able to successfully applied this method into another related project to help us model and uncover the experimental data in the real world senario. The findings were also published in Nature communications.

Out of from research, I am always interested in the
