Welcome! I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [Mixed Unit of Physics CNRS/Thales](https://www.cnrs-thales.fr/?lang=fr) in France, working with [Julie Grollier](https://www.neurophysics.cnrs-thales.fr/).

My academic journey began with a PhD at Université Paris-Saclay (UPSACLAY) and Beihang University, where I was fortunate to be co-supervised by [Damien Querlioz](https://sites.google.com/site/damienquerlioz) and [Dafiné Ravelosona](http://integnano.c2n.u-psud.fr/?page_id=146) at [Center for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology](https://www.c2n.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/). It was during my research project at C2N in France that I discovered my passion for AI, as I tackled complex problems in reservoir computing using the unique properties of spintronic nano-devices. By leveraging machine learning techniques to create an equivalent system to the original physical design, I managed to achieve remarkable accuracy and computational efficiency.

My current research interests are about bio-plausible learning rules of neural networks and their hardware implementations!
