Welcome! I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Mixed Unit of Physics CNRS/Thales in France. I am driven by the relentless pursuit of innovation and the desire to bridge the gap between physics and machine learning.

My academic journey began with a PhD at Université Paris-Saclay (UPSACLAY) and Beihang University, where I was fortunate to be co-supervised by [Damien Querlioz](https://sites.google.com/site/damienquerlioz) and [Dafiné Ravelosona](http://integnano.c2n.u-psud.fr/?page_id=146) at [Center for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology](https://www.c2n.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/). It was during my research project at C2N in France that I discovered my passion for AI, as I tackled complex problems in reservoir computing using the unique properties of spintronic nano-devices. By leveraging machine learning techniques to create an equivalent system to the original physical design, I managed to achieve remarkable accuracy and computational efficiency.

My mission is to harness the power of AI and the insights from physics-informed learning rules to drive meaningful advances in industry applications. I invite you to explore my website and learn more about my work, interests, and the exciting potential at the crossroads of these groundbreaking fields. 

Out of research, I am also interested in drawing, listening to podcasts, hiking, etc. I am also learning piano and skating board now!


### Research interests

My research interests lie in the intersection of [Neuromorphic (Brain-inspired) computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromorphic_engineering), [Spintronics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spintronics),  and Machine Learning. I am also very interested in the physics-informed learning rule and the applications of AI in the industry.

### Additional information

My passion for AI started when I was doing my research project at C2N in France. I was exploring the [reservoir computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_computing) algorithm (an elegant solution to these problems that RNNs traditionally face, and importantly, it is hardware friendly) for a complicated prediction task by utilizing the physical properties of a spintronic nano-device. The problem is that the conventional simulations tool makes running a regular benchmark task in reservoir computing exceptionally time-consuming. I solved the problem by [modeling an equivalent system using machine learning techniques](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28571-7) to the original physical design, and it proves to be entirely accurate and computationally efficient! This experience made me realize that between these two communities of physics and machine learning, many things can be borrowed and learned to be benificial for each other.
