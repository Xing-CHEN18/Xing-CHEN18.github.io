- ## Advancing the Forward-Forward Algorithm

**Related fields**: Noise contrastive Learning, visual representations, un/self-supervised learning

**Introduction**: The Forward-Forward Algorithm, as conceptualized by Geoffrey Hinton, is a novel approach to learning in neural networks. This learning method is particularly distinctive because it replaces the traditional forward and backward passes of backpropagation—fundamental to deep learning— with two forward passes. This project can be presented as a step towards more energy-efficient and potentially biologically realistic forms of learning in artificial neural networks. 

To learn more about the details, I would recommend watching his interview, or my post for a general intro:

**My Work**: I have developed an advanced method of generating negative data that diverges from and improves upon Geoffrey Hinton's initial Forward-Forward Algorithm framework. My approach has been tested on the CIFAR10 dataset, where it has not only achieved remarkable accuracy but also surpassed the performance benchmarks set by existing unsupervised local learning algorithms.

**Impact**: Improving machine learning models' interpretability. The implications extend to real-world applications, including but not limited to, enhanced computer vision systems, more efficient natural language processors, etc.

**Future work**: Scaling these methods for larger and more complex datasets and exploring the potential for broader applications in various AI domains. The mauscript is under preparation and code is going to be published.


- ## Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for modeling time series data

**Related fields**: Residual Network, Differential Equations, Time series forcasting

**Introduction**: This study addresses the gap in applying artificial intelligence to discover the complete differential equations governing physical experiments. It focuses on the domain of spintronics, where the behavior of devices underpins future technological advancements.

**My Contribution**: I led the initiative to adapt Neural Ordinary Differential Equations to spintronics' unique constraints, involving few outputs, multiple inputs, and internal parameters. Our model, trained on minimal data, successfully predicted spintronic devices' behaviors with remarkable accuracy and efficiency.

**Impact**: Our approach demonstrated an over 200-fold acceleration in simulation time compared to traditional methods, predicting the response of experimental spintronic nano-oscillators effectively. It stands to significantly speed up the development process in spintronics and potentially other areas involving dynamic electronic devices.

**Reflection/Future Work** The promising results from Neural ODEs in spintronics suggest a disruptive tool for rapid and accurate modeling, complementing time-intensive micromagnetic simulations. Looking ahead, we aim to generalize this approach to a broader range of electronic devices, optimizing the functionality and efficiency of next-generation technologies.
