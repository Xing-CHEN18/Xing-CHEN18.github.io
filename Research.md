## Generalization of the Forward-forward algorithm

Related field: Noise contrastive Learning, visual representations, un/self supervised learning

Introduction: The Forward-Forward algorithm replaces the forward and backward passes of backpropagation by two forward passes, one with positive (i.e. real) data and the other with negative data which could be generated by the network itself. Here is my post for a general intro:

My Work: Generalize the forward-forward algorithm in a broader situation and can be applied in different dataset with higher accuracy

Impact: Improving machine learning models' interpretability.
