Tunnel vision is defined as oneâ€™s tendency to focus on a single goal or point of view. The more important the goal or the more threatening a stimulus is perceived to be, the more likely a person is to focus attention on it [Ref](https://www.samatters.com/explaining-tunnel-vision/#:~:text=Tunnel%20vision%20is%20defined%20as,to%20focus%20attention%20on%20it.).

'Tunnel vision', when the first time I heard this psychology term in podcast, the scene of my uncle driving us through a black and long tunnel on the high way repeatedly played in my mind. I clearly remembered how I worridely and tightly staring at the bright circular region in front of the way. You always thought you were getting out from the current dark, but sorry, it was just a turn then you were still stuck in the dark facing the same situation. I cannot help but praise the invention of this term. I realized for many years of my life, I was stuck in my own 'tunnel'. I always thought: after I have fixed this problem in the front, my life will be easier/brighter/relaxing. OK, let's just focus on this problem without thinking anything else. The reality is that there won't be a day you think you have fixed all the problems, never! And you don't know how unexpected your next problem will be.

I feel a bit relaxed after I found this pattern according to the past experience. Instead of being immersed in the infinite anxieties, it might be a good time to change the focus.
