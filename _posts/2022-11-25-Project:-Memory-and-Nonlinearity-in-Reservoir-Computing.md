When talking about reservoir computing, one must mention that the reservoir's main requirements are nonlinearity and a memory effect, also known as the 'echo state property' in the context of Echo State Networks (see more in one of my other blog: ([What is and why reservoir computing](https://xing-chen18.github.io/Project-What-is-and-why-Reservoir-Computing/)). But why it isn't a system has certain memory effect must also have nonlinearity?
