I know that hot water from taps is not good to drink and cook long time ago, but i forgot to figure out why it is the case. When my friend asked me why when I stopped her from taking warm water for drinking, I pasused and could not answer. I searched and found it just because the hot water from the tap can contain contaminants. The cold water enters the water boiler heated by contact with the heating elements. Under heat and pressure, there is a transfer of metals from the heating elements and other components of the boiler. Hot water also dissolves contaminants in pipes faster than cold water.

So, do remind your friend next time;)

This moment of pause, a hiccup in our day-to-day routine, is a subtle reminder of the layers of complexity that lie beneath the surface of our seemingly mundane world. How often do we turn the tap, watch the water flow, and take for granted its journey to us? It's a journey that begins far from the confines of our kitchen, intertwining with the earth's own elements, plumbing systems, and the intricate dance between nature and human engineering.

But it's not just about the water, or the contaminants, or the pipes. It's about the pattern we've all fallen intoâ€”assuming the ordinary is just that, ordinary. Yet, if we dare to look a little closer, question a little deeper, and wonder a little more, we find that the world around us is teeming with nuances and knowledge waiting to be uncovered.
