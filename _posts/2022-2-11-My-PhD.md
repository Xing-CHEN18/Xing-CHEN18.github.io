title: How does FFT helps in micromagnetic simulations

In micromagnetic simulations, _Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)_ is particularly helpful in calculating magnetostatic (dipolar) interactions.

Magnetostatic interactions are long-range interactions that arise due to the presence of magnetic charges on the surfaces of magnetic domains. These interactions have a significant influence on the overall behavior of magnetic materials, including domain formation, domain wall motion, and magnetization dynamics. Accurate calculation of magnetostatic interactions is crucial for reliable micromagnetic simulations.

Computing magnetostatic interactions directly in the spatial domain can be computationally expensive, especially for large systems or fine discretization grids. However, with FFT, it is possible to perform these calculations more efficiently in the frequency domain. _But be careful_, even with the use of the FFT, the micromagnetic simulations can still be extremely time-consuming and the calculation of this interaction terms is still the main source of long simulation time: For example for simulation of a spin-torque nano-oscillator with size of ~100 nm, the simulation time could be in the order of minutes to hours without magnetostatic field, and could range from a few hours to a day or more With magnetostatic field (depending on the mesh resolution, simulation settings, and the hardware resources available)

_This is also a big problem that I met in my project, and that's why I started exploring other methods that can help solve this long simulation time problem!_

But still, I would like to help you figure out how is demagnetization is calculated with the assistance of the FFT.


### Calculation of demagnetization field

The demagnetization field, which can be derived from the Maxwell equation (checkout [my thesis](https://theses.hal.science/tel-03770225/document) for the derivation), can be expressed as (neglecting the coefficient):

\\[
mathbf{H}_\text{demag}(\mathbf{r}) = \int \frac{\rho_m(\mathbf{r'})}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r'}|^3} (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r'}) d\mathbf{r'}
\\]

where \\(\rho_m = -\nabla \cdot \mathbf{M}\\) is the charge density. Using the Green's function (\\( G(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{r'}) = \frac{1}{4\pi|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r'}|} \\) with its derivative \\(
   \nabla G(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{r'}) = -\frac{\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r'}}{4\pi|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r'}|^3}
   \\) ), it can be further expressed as:
   
\\[
\mathbf{H}_\text{demag}(\mathbf{r}) = \int {V}\nabla G(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{r'}) \rho_m(\mathbf{r'})
\\]


\\[
 \mathbf{H}_\text{demag}(\mathbf{r}) = \int_{V'} \nabla G(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{r'})  \rho_m(\mathbf{r'}) dV'
\\]

Recalling the formation of [_Convolution of two functions_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution), we hereby obtain a simplified verion of the expression：

\\[
 \mathbf{H}_\text{demag}(\mathbf{r}) = \nabla G(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{r'}) * \rho_m(\mathbf{r'})
\\]

where \\(\*\\) denotes the convolution operation.

_The convolution theorem_, which establishes a relationship between the convolution operation in the spatial (or time) domain and the multiplication operation in the frequency domain, states that the Fourier Transform of the convolution of two functions is equal to the product of the Fourier Transforms of the individual functions. Therefore, to calculate the demagnetization field, \\( \mathbf{H}_\text{demag}(\mathbf{r}) \\), we can firstly calculate  the convolution of the gradient of the Green's function, \\( \nabla G(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{r'}) \\), and the magnetic charge density, \\( \rho_m(\mathbf{r'}) \\), which can be expressed as:

\\[
\mathcal{F}\{\mathbf{H}_\text{demag}(\mathbf{r})\}(\mathbf{k}) = \mathcal{F}\{\nabla G(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{r'})\}(\mathbf{k}) \cdot \mathcal{F}\{\rho_m(\mathbf{r'})\}(\mathbf{k})
\\]

where \\( \mathcal{F}\{\cdot\} \\) denotes the Fourier Transform, and \\( \mathbf{k} \\) represents the frequency domain.

The demagnetization field in the spatial domain can therefore be obtained by applying the inverse Fourier Transform:

\\[
\mathbf{B}_\text{demag}(\mathbf{r}) = \mathcal{F}^{-1}\{\mathcal{F}\{\nabla G(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{r'})\}(\mathbf{k}) \cdot \mathcal{F}\{\rho_m(\mathbf{r'})\}(\mathbf{k})\}(t)
\\]

### Benefits of transferring to the frequency domain 

The benefits of transferring to the frequency doman comes from the advantage of using the FFT (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) algorithm. The naïve approach to compute the convolution of two functions, both having N elements, has a computational complexity of $O(N^2)$. However, the FFT algorithm computes the discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of an N-element function in $O(N \log N)$ time. This computational efficiency also applies to the inverse FFT (IFFT).

Thus, by using the FFT to transform the functions to the frequency domain, perform element-wise multiplication, and then transform the result back to the spatial domain using IFFT, the overall computation is significantly faster compared to the direct computation of the convolution in the spatial domain.

In Micromagnetic simulations, this procedure is done in descretized cells in simulation softwares such as Mumax or OOMMF.
