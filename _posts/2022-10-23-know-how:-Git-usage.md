To creat a repository of an exsisting project in github from your local server:

1. [Create a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) in Github website. **To avoid errors, do not initialize the new repository with README, license, or gitignore files.** (This is important as I did mistakes at the beginning after clicking add README)

2. Use the init command to initialize the local directory as a Git repository.
