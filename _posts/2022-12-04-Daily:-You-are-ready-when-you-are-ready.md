One of the enlighting take-aways from one of my favorite podcasts -- 得意忘形 (literally means someone gets so arrogant to an extent that she/he forgets who she/he is) that I listened recently is that just getting started/moving towards it/getting into action whenever you have an idea instead of overthinking. 

I realized the most difficult part for me is not to get started (which I feel happy about that), but to keep on doing things that I think is important or correct. For example, I think keep writing blogs to record my thinking during my research and my life either to reflect myself or to help others is meaningful. But I failed to keep the consistency just after doing it for several days. I think keep learning french is necessary, extremely useful and interesting at the same time, I was full of enthusiastic about my detailed study plan for the near future, but I lost the fighting spirit after a few days of consistency (though i still have motivation:). Is that possible they are just not that important than you imagined? How can I break through from these embarrassing situations? I think most people met similar situations, let's understand it a bit more.

**From a psychological standpoint**, it is a common human phenomenon. The initial burst of enthusiasm often triggers the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with feelings of pleasure and motivation. It’s dopamine that gives that rush of excitement when you start a new project or learn something new. However, as the task becomes routine and the learning curve levels off, the novelty wanes, and so does the dopamine response. This shift from novelty to routine can lead to what's called the 'hedonic treadmill' or 'hedonic adaptation'—our tendency to quickly return to a relatively stable level of happiness despite major positive or negative events or life changes. When the newness of an activity fades, we often struggle to maintain the same level of happiness and motivation we initially felt.

Furthermore, the Zeigarnik effect, a psychological phenomenon which states that people remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks, can actually be harnessed to your advantage. Leaving a task slightly unfinished may increase the likelihood of returning to it, as our brains linger on unsolved or incomplete work. The notion that the importance of a task may be inflated at the outset is also grounded in psychological principles. The 'planning fallacy,' a term coined by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, refers to our tendency to underestimate the time, costs, and risks of future actions, while at the same time overestimating the benefits. Thus, the initial appeal of a new venture, like learning a language or writing a blog, can be magnified in our minds.

**Then, how can we navigate these cognitive patterns**

Setting smaller, incremental goals can help maintain a sense of achievement and provide ongoing motivation. Behavioral psychologists also suggest using implementation intentions—specific plans about when, where, and how we will perform a behavior—as these can increase the likelihood of follow-through.

Self-compassion is also key. Understanding that what you're experiencing is a natural part of human behavior can alleviate some of the self-imposed stigma around 'failing' to maintain new habits. Research on self-compassion suggests that being kind to yourself during times of perceived failure can actually increase motivation and improve emotional well-being.

Finally, re-evaluating the intrinsic value you place on tasks like writing and language learning can reignite your commitment. If these activities align with your deeper values and sense of purpose, reflecting on this alignment can rekindle your motivation.

In conclusion, the ebb and flow of enthusiasm and motivation are not merely personal quirks but are woven into the fabric of human psychology. Hope everyone can be self-consistent, make joyful progress, and cheer for every little achievement of their own.

Many people have suffered from the boring daily routines of their work and dreamed about only doing their favorite activities. It seems in very rare cases that what people are doing in their work is what they really like. So the reality is that it is extremely difficult to be one of the extermely lucky guys. But I started to think seriously about what kind of activites can give me the most fulfillment and pleasure when I have to started to look for a job. Thinking of my interests, what shows up in my mind is all about drawing, design, creation, ect. From this perpective, this also gives me a strong reason to keep on what I am doing now (drawing and writing blogs). I know I am just nobody at the moment, but I need to start to do it to creat a possibility.

I found myself more peaceful when facing changes in my life, and started to see things from different perspectives. I know I would say after many years: Oh! that difficult period just occupied a small piece of my life, I have done many interesting things, I re-visited myself, and developed myself.

PS: I also startd again to learn how to play piano, for myself, and also for someone who made the donation:)
