One of the enlighting take-aways from one of my favorite podcasts -- 得意忘形 (literally means someone gets so arrogant to an extent that she/he forgets who she/he is) that I listened recently is that just getting started/moving towards it/getting into action whenever you have an idea instead of overthinking. I realized the most difficult part for me is not to get started (which I feel a bit pleased about myself:P), but to keep on doing things that I think is important or correct. For example, I think keep writing blogs to record my thinking during my research and my life either to reflect myself or to help others is meaningful. But I failed to keep the consistency just after doing it for several days. I think keep learning french is necessary, extremely useful and interesting at the same time, I was full of enthusiastic about my detailed study plan for the near future, but I lost the fighting spirit after a few days of consistency (though i still have motivation). Is that possible they are just not that important than you imagined?
