One of the enlighting take-aways from one of my favorite podcasts -- 得意忘形 (literally means someone gets so arrogant to an extent that she/he forgets who she/he is) that I listened recently is that just getting started/moving towards it/getting into action whenever you have an idea instead of overthinking. 

I realized the most difficult part for me is not to get started (which I feel happy about that), but to keep on doing things that I think is important or correct. For example, I think keep writing blogs to record my thinking during my research and my life either to reflect myself or to help others is meaningful. But I failed to keep the consistency just after doing it for several days. I think keep learning french is necessary, extremely useful and interesting at the same time, I was full of enthusiastic about my detailed study plan for the near future, but I lost the fighting spirit after a few days of consistency (though i still have motivation:). Is that possible they are just not that important than you imagined? How can I break through from these embarrassing situations?

Many people have suffered from the boring daily routines of their work and dreamed about only doing their favorite activities. It seems in very rare cases that what people are doing in their work is what they really like. So the reality is that it is extremely difficult to be one of the extermely lucky guys. But I started to think seriously about what kind of activites can give me the most fulfillment and pleasure when I have to started to look for a job. Thinking of my interests, what shows up in my mind is all about drawing, design, creation, ect. From this perpective, this also gives me a strong reason to keep on what I am doing now (drawing and writing blogs). I know I am just nobody at the moment, but I need to start to do it to creat a possibility.

I found myself more peaceful when facing changes in my life, and started to see things from different perspectives. I know I would say after many years: Oh! that difficult period just occupied a small piece of my life, I have done many interesting things, I re-visited myself, and developed myself.

PS: I also startd again to learn how to play piano, for myself, and also for someone who made the donation:)
