WeChat and Alipay payment system with a QR code is quite convenient and popular in China. You just need to scan a QR code provided by the mechants using your mobile, the money is easily transfered and paied. From the perspective of merchants, OR code for receiving money is easily acquired, by just printing it out, compared to buying a pos machine with high cost. However, it seems that paying through QR code is rare in Europearn countries. There might be a few reasons for that:

- Other competitive methods: Card payment & paypal. Card payment method has been very well established, and it can be easily integrated with mobile through paypal. 
- Technology aspect: No such unified standards. There are several standards (on both ends agreement on the content of the OR code) existing, which makes it difficult to be promoted and applied.
- Limitation: Paying with QR code relies on the internet access. 

Does technology limit people or liberate them? Sometimes I feel I just wanted to throw my phone out of my sight, but i cannot because it knows me more than I doï¼Œnot to mention its use as a tool for integrating many functions.
