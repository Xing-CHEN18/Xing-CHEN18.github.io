WeChat and Alipay payment system with a QR code is quite convenient and popular in China. You just need to scan a QR code provided by the mechants using your mobile, the money is easily transfered and paied. From the perspective of merchants, OR code for receiving money is easily acquired, by just printing it out, compared to buying a pos machine with high cost. However, it seems that paying through QR code is rare in Europearn countries. There might be a few reasons for that:

- Technology aspect: No such unified standards. There are several standards (on both ends agreement on the content of the OR code) existing, which makes it difficult to be promoted and applied.
