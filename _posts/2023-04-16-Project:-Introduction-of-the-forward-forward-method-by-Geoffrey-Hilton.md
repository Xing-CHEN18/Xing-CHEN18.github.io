Here's a nice video about interview of Geoffrey Hilton on his new Forwarad Forward algorithm, which I am currently working on based on his preliminary research. This interview is pretty cool as it shows us how a great idea was generated: thousands of times of trying, large amount of reading, consistent curiosity and explorations... and also hard working. "To have a great idea have a lot of them!" As Thomas Edison said,

Here is a timeline about this video:

2.11: **why looking for something Beyond back propagation despite its tremendous success** 

Back propagation is a way of how much a change in the weight would make the system have less error and then you change the weight in proportion to how much it helps and obviously it hurts if you change it in the opposite direction. To calculate this weight change, it has to use the same connectivity pattern with the same weights but in the backwards Direction and it has to go backwards through the non-linearity of the neuron. There's no evidence that the brain is doing that. **The worst case** is that if you're doing back propagation in a recurrent net because you meed tp run the recurrent net forwards in time and then you have to run it backwards through time in order to get all these derivatives so as to change the weights. That's particularly problematic if for example if you're trying to process video because you can't stop and go backwards in time. So combined with the fact that there's no good evidence the brain does it, there's the problem that just for technology it's a mess it interrupts the pipelining of stuff through so you'd really like something like video there's been multiple stages of processing and you'd like to just pipeline the inputs through those multiple stages and just keep pipelining it through.
