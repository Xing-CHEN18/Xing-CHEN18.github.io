Here's a nice video about interview of Geoffrey Hilton on his new Forwarad Forward algorithm, which I am currently working on based on his preliminary research. This interview is pretty cool as it shows us how a great idea was generated: thousands of times of trying, large amount of reading, consistent curiosity and explorations... and also hard working. "To have a great idea have a lot of them!" As Thomas Edison said,

Here is a timeline about this video:

2.11: **why looking for something Beyond back propagation despite its tremendous success** 

and back propagation is a way of
figuring out that gradient we're
figuring out how much a change in the
weight would make the system have less
error and then you change the weight in
proportion to how much it helps and
obviously if it hurts you change it in
the opposite direction
now about propagation
looks like the forward pass but it goes
backwards it has to use the same
connectivity pattern with the same
weights but in the backwards Direction
and it has to go backwards through the
non-linearity of the neuron there's no
evidence that the brain is doing that
and there's lots of elements it's not
doing that
so the worst case is if you're doing
back propagation in a recurrent net
because then you run the recurrent net
forwards in time
and it outputs an answer at the end of
running forwards in time
and then you have to run it backwards
through time
in order to get all these derivatives so
I had to change the weights
and that's particularly problematic if
for example if you're trying to process
video
you can't stop and go backwards in time
so combined with the fact that there's
no evidence the brain does it
well no good evidence
there's the problem that just for
technology it's a mess it interrupts the
pipelining of stuff through so you'd
really like something like video there's
been multiple stages of processing and
you'd like to just pipeline the inputs
through those multiple stages and just
keep pipelining it through
