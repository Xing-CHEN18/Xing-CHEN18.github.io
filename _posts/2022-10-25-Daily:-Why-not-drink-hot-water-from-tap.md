I know that hot water from taps is not good to drink and cook long time ago, but i forgot to figure out why it is the case. When my friend asked me why when I stopped her from taking warm water for drinking, I pasused and could not answer. I searched and found it just because the hot water from the tap can contain contaminants. The cold water enters the water boiler heated by contact with the heating elements. Under heat and pressure, there is a transfer of metals from the heating elements and other components of the boiler. Hot water also dissolves contaminants in pipes faster than cold water.

So, do remind your friend next time;)
