## The beginning of the story

I started to know about Reservoir computing (RC) at the third year of my PhD where I was trying to apply my research findings about dynamic skyrmions into a fancy application, eg. neuromorphic, AI, etc. The idea of RC attracted me because it perfectly merges the idea of complex neural network for a fancy task (just a demonstration) and a dynamic physical system, that could exsist almost everywhere (simply from a drop of water to any experimental systems in research labs)! This can actually be expanded to the idea of "computing", which happens at almost every moment and naturally in every systems (see the following pic where a bucket water was used to do pattern recognition for the tasks of XOR and spoken digit recognition, see also original paper: [Pattern recognition in a bucket](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-39432-7_63)).

## What is RC?

There are many research articles, thesis and tutorials that talk about RC ([Reservoir computing approaches to recurrent neural network training](https://amygdala.psychdept.arizona.edu/CompNeuro/Readings/week13/Lukosevicius-Jaeger+Reservoir-computing-recurrent-neural-network+CompSciRev+2019.pdf), [Hands-on reservoir computing: a tutorial for practical implementation](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2634-4386/ac7db7/pdf), [Recent advances in physical reservoir computing: A review](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.04962.pdf), [Theory and Modeling of Complex Nonlinear Delay Dynamics Applied to Neuromorphic Computing](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01591441/file/PhD_thesis-Penkovsky-arch.pdf)). RC was firstly proposed to solve the problems that Recurrent Neural Network training usually met. More specifically, traditional way of training RNN is based on the gradient descent method (In RNN, it is called back-propagation through time, BPTT). However, this method is not
