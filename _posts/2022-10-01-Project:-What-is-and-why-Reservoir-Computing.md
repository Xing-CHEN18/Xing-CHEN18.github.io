## The beginning of the story

I started to know about Reservoir computing (RC) at the third year of my PhD where I was trying to apply my research findings about dynamic skyrmions into a fancy application, eg. neuromorphic, AI, etc. The idea of RC attracted me because it perfectly merges the idea of complex neural network for a fancy task (just a demonstration) and a dynamic physical system, that could exsist almost everywhere (simply from a drop of water to any experimental systems in research labs)!
